# Troubleshooting Google Apps Script

## Issue Detected
The Google Apps Script URL is returning "Page Not Found" error. This means either:
1. The script wasn't properly deployed
2. The deployment has an error
3. The URL is incorrect

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Check Your Google Apps Script Deployment
1. Go to your Google Apps Script project: [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click on your "Rays Innovations Form Handler" project
3. Click "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
4. Check if the deployment is active

### 2. Redeploy the Script
1. In your Google Apps Script project
2. Click "Deploy" → "New deployment"
3. Change the version to "New version"
4. Description: "Fix form submission"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the NEW web app URL

### 3. Verify Script Permissions
1. Make sure "Execute as" is set to "Me"
2. Make sure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"
3. If prompted, authorize the script

### 4. Test the Script
Visit your Google Apps Script URL in a browser. You should see:
"Rays Innovations Form Handler is running. Use POST to submit form data."

If you see an error page, the deployment failed.

## Alternative Solution: Use a Simple Form Endpoint

If Google Apps Script continues to have issues, we can use other services:

### Option A: Formspree (Recommended)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Get the form endpoint URL
5. I'll update the code to use it

### Option B: Google Forms (Simplest)
1. Create a Google Form with the same fields
2. Get the form submission URL
3. Submit data directly to the form

## Current Status
The forms are ready to work - we just need a working endpoint. Once you fix the Google Apps Script deployment or choose an alternative, the forms will immediately start saving data.
