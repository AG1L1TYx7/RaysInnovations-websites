# Troubleshooting Empty Google Sheet

## Issue: Google Sheet is Empty Despite Successful Form Submissions

Your website is sending data correctly (we can see it in the console logs), but the Google Sheet remains empty. This indicates an issue with the Google Apps Script.

## Possible Causes:

### 1. **Script Permissions Issue**
- The Google Apps Script might not have permission to write to your sheet
- Need to re-authorize the script

### 2. **Script Deployment Issue** 
- The web app deployment might not be active
- Script might be deployed with wrong permissions

### 3. **Sheet Access Issue**
- The script might not be able to access the specific Google Sheet
- Sheet ID might be incorrect

## How to Fix:

### Step 1: Test the Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your "Rays Innovations Form Handler" project
3. Click the function dropdown and select "testSheetAccess"
4. Click the Run button (▶️)
5. Check the execution log for errors

### Step 2: Re-deploy the Web App
1. In your Google Apps Script project
2. Click "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Change the version to "New version"
5. Ensure settings are:
   - **Execute as**: "Me"
   - **Who has access**: "Anyone"
6. Click "Deploy"
7. **Copy the new URL** and provide it to me

### Step 3: Check Sheet Permissions
1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dlKksFNspUJUI0OWIwD_9hzzON8CJv6nma7SUvvFOSM/edit
2. Make sure you're logged into the same Google account as the script
3. Try manually adding a test row to confirm you have edit access

### Step 4: Manual Test
1. In your Google Apps Script, run the "testSheetAccess" function
2. This will attempt to write test data directly to your sheet
3. Check if the test data appears in your Google Sheet

## What to Check For:
- ✅ Script runs without errors
- ✅ You see "Sheet access successful" in the logs
- ✅ Test data appears in your Google Sheet
- ✅ New web app URL works when visited

Once you complete these steps, let me know what errors (if any) you see, and I'll help fix the issue.
